        ALL Progressive Congress officials have confirmed that they have initiated talks with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State ahead of the 2023 elections with a view to woo him away from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).<br/>
        <br/>

In late June, the PDP elected former vice president Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as its flagbearer for next year's presidential election at its annual convention.<br/>
<br/>

Governor Wike of Rivers State was a candidate in that election but he was beaten into second place and to make matters worse for him, he was not then picked as the party's running mate.<br/>
<br/>

 With Alhaji Abubakar opting to pick Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as his running mate, Governor Wike went on the war path and began fraternising with the ruling APC. Along with four other governors, Governor Wike has called for the immediate resignation of PDP chairman Senator Iyorese Ayu as a condition for them supporting Alhaji Abubakar's presidential campaign.<br/>
 <br/>

Known as the G5, these governors have held numerous meetings with the Atiku camp but so far, both sides have been unable to reach a compromise. With no sign of the impasse being resolved, APC chieftain, Farouk Aliyu, said the party wants Governor Wike’s backing during the next general elections.<br/>
<br/>

However, Speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Today programme last night, Mr Aliyu said the APC was ready to receive Governor Wike as a new member ahead of the next general election. Yesterday, Governor Wike endorsed the APC's Governor Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos State for a second term, indicating that he is about to exit the PDP.<br/>
<br/>

Mr Aliyu said: “We are talking to Wike and we are talking to so many of them. Of course, it is politics, so, we are not enemies of Wike and he is a very important person in this country, a governor for that matter –and you cannot ignore Rivers State.<br/>
<br/>

“So, if Wike decides to come to us, we would gladly welcome him. I can confirm to you that we are talking to him.”<br/>
<br/>

It is not yet clear, however, if these defection talks only include Governor Wike or also involve the other members of the G5. Other governors in the group include Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State.<br/>
<br/>

GOVERNOR Samuel Ortom of Benue State has hinted that he may decide to back former Anambra State governor Peter Obi in next year's presidential elections pointing out that he cannot publicly support...<br/>
