        ALL Progressive Congress officials have confirmed that they have initiated talks with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State ahead of the 2023 elections with a view to woo him away from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).<br/>
        <br/>

In late June, the PDP elected former vice president Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as its flagbearer for next year's presidential election at its annual convention.<br/>
<br/>

Governor Wike of Rivers State was a candidate in that election but he was beaten into second place and to make matters worse for him, he was not then picked as the party's running mate.<br/>
<br/>

 With Alhaji Abubakar opting to pick Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as his running mate, Governor Wike went on the war path and began fraternising with the ruling APC. Along with four other governors, Governor Wike has called for the immediate resignation of PDP chairman Senator Iyorese Ayu as a condition for them supporting Alhaji Abubakar's presidential campaign.<br/>
 <br/>

Known as the G5, these governors have held numerous meetings with the Atiku camp but so far, both sides have been unable to reach a compromise. With no sign of the impasse being resolved, APC chieftain, Farouk Aliyu, said the party wants Governor Wike’s backing during the next general elections.<br/>
<br/>

However, Speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Today programme last night, Mr Aliyu said the APC was ready to receive Governor Wike as a new member ahead of the next general election. Yesterday, Governor Wike endorsed the APC's Governor Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos State for a second term, indicating that he is about to exit the PDP.<br/>
<br/>

Mr Aliyu said: “We are talking to Wike and we are talking to so many of them. Of course, it is politics, so, we are not enemies of Wike and he is a very important person in this country, a governor for that matter –and you cannot ignore Rivers State.<br/>
<br/>

“So, if Wike decides to come to us, we would gladly welcome him. I can confirm to you that we are talking to him.”<br/>
<br/>

It is not yet clear, however, if these defection talks only include Governor Wike or also involve the other members of the G5. Other governors in the group include Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State.<br/>
<br/>

GOVERNOR Samuel Ortom of Benue State has hinted that he may decide to back former Anambra State governor Peter Obi in next year's presidential elections pointing out that he cannot publicly support...<br/>

GOVERNOR Samuel Ortom of Benue State has hinted that he may decide to back former Anambra State governor Peter Obi in next year's presidential elections pointing out that he cannot publicly support him now because they are in different parties.<br/>
<br/>

In February next year, Nigeria goes to the polls and there are currently four frontrunners seeking the job of presidency including Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi of the Labour Party and Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party.<br/>
<br/>

Governor Ortom was originally elected as an APC governor in 2015 but in 2018 he switched to the APC and in 2019 was re-elected on tat platform.<br/>
<br/>

Now Governor Ortom is a member of the PDP's G5 group of governors who are opposed to the candidacy of Alhaji Abubakar and who would rather Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State was the party's presidential candidate.  They shunned the PDP presidential campaign launch and Governor Wike is rumoured to be considering joining the APC and supporting its presidential candidate Asiwaju Tinubu.<br/>
<br/>

Yesterday, Governor Ortom net with Peter Obi, the former Anambra State governor and Labour Party presidential candidate Obi at his private residence in Abuja, where he said he admired his former colleague. At the meeting, Governor Ortom said he would have worked for the success of Governor Obi if he were not to be a member of the PDP.<br/>
<br/>

Governor Ortom said:  “I’m in PDP and I am working for PDP but I tell you if I were not in PDP, you will see me working for Peter Obi but I am in PDP. Let’s see how things work our but the truth is that the bible says a man can receive nothing except it is given it to him.”<br/>
<br/>

He added that Governor Obi may not have the wherewithal but if God decides no one can stop it and urged Nigerians to elect the best among the candidates without any sentiments. He also urged Governor Peter Obi, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to meet and agree on one of them.<br/>
<br/>

IGBO traditional rulers and religious clergymen have issued a joint statement calling on the federal government to honour the recent Federal Court of Appeal judgement which called for the release of the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob) leader Nnamdi Kanu.<br/>
<br/>

Last Thursday, Nigeria's Court of Appeal declared Nnamdi Kanu's detention illegal and unlawful and quashed the terrorism charges brought against him by the federal government.<br/>
<br/>

In a judgment delivered by Justice Oludotun Adefope-Okojie, the criminal charges by the federal government against Mr Kanu were thus voided and set aside.<br/>
<br/>

According to the court, the federal government, having flagrantly breached the fundamental rights of Mr Kanu, lost the legal right to put him on trial. Also, the court held that laws are meant to be obeyed and that the federal government has no reason to have taken laws into her own hand in the illegal and unlawful way the matter of Mr Kanu was handled.<br/>
<br/>

However, Abubakar Malami, Nigeria's attorney-general, has hinted that the federal government will not release Mr Kanu but would rather file fresh charges against him. He added that Mr Kanu was only discharged and not acquitted and the federal government will consider all available options on the judgment on rendition while pursuing determination of pre-rendition issues.<br/>
<br/>

In a swift response, the South East Council of Traditional Rulers and Representatives of Igbo Archbishops and Bishops On Peace and Conflict Resolution issued a statement asking the federal government to respect the judgement of the court. Their statement was signed by several prominent traditional rulers including of Onitsha, Obi Alfred Nnaemeka Achebe, who is the chairman of Anambra State Council of traditional rulers.<br/>
<br/>

Others personalities who co-signed the statement include Reverend Dr Chibuzo Opoko, the Methodist Archbishop of Umuahia; Igwe Ambassador  LOC Agubuzu, the chairman of the Enugu State Traditional Rulers Council and Most Reverend Dr Valerian Okeke, the Catholic Archbishop of Onitsha. According to the group, in the recent past, it has undertaken extensive and intense behind-the-scenes consultations with all stakeholders to broker a permanent, regionally coordinated restoration of the southeast to the status as the most peaceful and progressive sub-national zone in Nigeria.<br/>
<br/>

Their statement read: “We welcome this judgement and assert that the wisdom of the Appellate Court presents a timely and an unprecedented opportunity to overcome the challenge of trust that has obstructed the path to peace. It also opens the window to winning the hearts and minds of the people.<br/>
<br/>

"We therefore unequivocally support the call for the immediate release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in line with the unanimous judgement of the court that his extradition and subsequent trial was illegal, and the lower court had no jurisdiction to hear the case. This joint body has been consistent and persistent in its call for all stakeholders to not relent in the pursuit of peace-building and resolution of security challenges in the southeast, based on justice, equity, fairness, love, mutual understanding, and respect of all persons.<br/>
<br/>

“In furtherance of this, we have also supported the call for the unconditional release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu by the federal government to douse the current tensions across the southeast and create an atmosphere for collaboration towards a constructive resolution of the issues.<br/>

<br/>
“In conclusion, the march towards peace and the restoration of normalcy in our society and economy requires the collective action of all people of God. We are confident that all Nigerians will rise to the summons of history and act with courage, conviction and integrity.”
